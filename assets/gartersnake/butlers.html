			<h2>Identification</h2>
			<p title="Identification">
				The Butler's Garter Snake is a medium sized (averaging lengths of 15-20 inches), 
				slender snake with three yellow to orange stripes along the length of the body. 
				The background colour can range from brown, black or olive and it may also be possible 
				to discern two rows of dark spots between the side and back stripes. These features do 
				little to distinguish them from most other garter snakes species, but what is unique 
				to this species is the placement of the lateral, or side, stripes. In Butler's Garter 
				Snakes, the lateral stripes are centred on the third scale row up from the ventral scales, 
				and they also overlap the adjacent second and fourth scale rows. This contrasts the 
				lateral stripe placement of other garter snake species. For those hoping to avoid getting 
				close enough to inspect the position of the lateral stripe, there are other features which
				may help in their identification! The head is unusually small for a garter snake, and, 
				when excited, the effort this snake expends to escape seems to go more towards thrashing 
				in place than to getting away.

			<h2>Distribution and Status</h2>
			<p>
				The distribution of the Butler's Garter Snake extends from central Ohio, 
				west to central Indiana, north through eastern Michigan and into the 
				adjacent southern portion of Ontario, Canada. Disjunct populations can 
				also be found in southeastern Wisconsin and in the central peninsula of 
				southern Ontario. Map. The Butler's Garter Snake is listed as state Endangered 
				in Indiana and state Threatened in Wisconsin. The current status of the 
				species in Michigan is unknown, but is thought to be locally common in 
				remaining patches of suitable habitat. The story is similar in Ohio. The 
				species is absent from Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Missouri.

			<h3>Ecology</h3>
			<p>
				Butler's Garter Snakes inhabit moist, grassy, open canopy areas, such as meadows, 
				wet prairies, marshes, savanna and grasslands. Like the Kirtland's Snake, they may 
				also be found in grassy vacant lots in suburban and residential areas. The species 
				can often be found under rocks, logs, trash and boards. Butler's Garter Snakes subsist 
				on a diet of mainly earthworms, but they may also eat leeches, salamanders and frogs. 
				The species hibernates communally, often with other garter snake species. Butler's 
				Garter Snakes are a relatively short-lived species and they reach sexual maturity in 
				their second spring. The species is also ovoviviparous.

				To pass the winter in a state of rest. During this time metabolic rate and body 
				temperature are much lower than during the active season.Embryos are contained 
				in eggs with persistent membranes, but there is no calcareous shell. The young 
				break out of the membrane during the birthing process, and so are born "live." 
				Grassland area with scattered trees. Savannas are usually transitional areas between 
				grasslands and forests.

			<h3>Threats and Management Issues</h3>
			<p>
				Habitat loss and degradation are playing a major role in the decline 
				of this species. While the distribution range appears fairly continuous,
				known populations are actually quite separate from one another. 
				Like many other imperilled species, Butler's Garter Snake populations 
				are becoming more and more isolated in dwindling patches of suitable habitat. 
				This has serious consequences for the future of the species as the likelihood 
				of maintaining a diverse gene pool is diminished as a result of their limited 
				ability to disperse. An excellent resource available to land owners and land 
				managers is the Habitat Management Guidelines for Reptiles and Amphibians of 
				the Midwest. This guide provides some thoughts and ideas on improving and better 
				managing different habitats while keeping reptiles and amphibians in mind.
